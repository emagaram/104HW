# How to build

    make all

## Other notes

I finished every problem and tested them so everything should work. Ignore the deque.cpp file, I used it for testing. The tests.cpp file is also a test file I used but it runs doctest. It should work though just by compiling and doing ./tests. I developed in vscode and changed some of the tasks.json and launch.json files which is why i pushed the .vscode folder. All .o files are put in the obj folder for neatness.
