<h1>Development notes</h1>
I developed in VSCode on windows with ming and g++ compiler and also tested in sublime so things should work. I passed all HW6 tests when I ran them so I think they should all work. I couldn't get the SCC tests to run so I manually ran it myself a few times with different inputs and it all worked. Also given how this HW required HW5, I wasn't sure which files to keep and which to add to my .gitignore so I kept my test files and .dat files.
