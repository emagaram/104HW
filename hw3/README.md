<h1>Known issues</h1>

I'm not sure if you  wanted two :: or not, sorry! I read the FAQ too late :(
I forgot to implement datetime operators since I did not need them, will try to create them rn though!


<h1>Development notes</h1>

I developed in VSCode on windows with ming and g++ compiler and also tested in sublime so things should work. Please email me if not. All tests were run using the doctest framework and they can be found in Tests.cpp. This took me a tremendous amount of time btw, way more than 15hours but I enjoyed it!
