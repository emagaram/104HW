<h1>Known issues</h1>

I'm not sure if you  wanted two :: or not. I also ran out of time again to delete memory in TwitEng but I know I needed to delete contents of users, mentionfeeds, and more

 
<h1>Development notes</h1>

I developed in VSCode on windows with ming and g++ compiler and also tested in sublime so things should work. Please email me if not. All tests were run using the doctest framework and they can be found in Tests.cpp. compiling it with the "make" command should work.
